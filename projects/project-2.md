summary: The Network Simulator was designed to transfer files at a specific amount of bytes from client to server and vice versa utilizing different tools and methods. 
---

-Worked in a team to design and improve upon this simulator to upload and download files between client and server.

-Upon improvements, the simulator can utilize a simplified DNS server, allowing a user to use a remote hostâ€™s domain name to download files from remote host.

-Specifically, I worked on the upload functionality of this program that allows it to upload in multiple packets up to a specific amount of bytes.
