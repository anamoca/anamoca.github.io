-This simple calculator was designed to be able to calculate equations and functions and output a number with variable amount of digits. 

-This includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

-I assisted in working on the addition and multiplication operations while providing assistance towards other portions of the code when needed.

- Upon use we had to simply input the numbers and operation used to calculate a solution between these two numbers, afterwards the amount of digits that can be displayed is provided as a changeable option for the user.
