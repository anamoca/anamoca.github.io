## Why is UI Frameworks worth it?
UI Framework, from what I've learned, is a set of software tools that we as programmers can use to build software programs to run and manage the web. Web developers utilize such tools to further develop user interfaces for many different reasons, such as mobile web applications specific for mobile devices. It can basically allow developers to build and manage multi-functional applications that are responsive and without the need to complicate things with deep and technical knowledge and skills. Although, known by many others, learning how to use and utilize UI Frameworks can be as difficult as learning new programming languages. Regardless of the difficulty, it seems to be worth the investment of time and frustration due to how beneficial it can be in terms of web design and management. There are those who prefer to use raw HTML and CSS without the need of UI Frameworks, which is fine because that's an option that they chose to go about doing things. Though, in my opinion, learning things such as Semantic UI does seem more beneficial and efficient once you get used to using it. 

## What do I think about it?
From my personal experience in using Semantic UI to design websites, it was difficult at first. Not everything can be simple on the first few attempts. I was definitely struggling with all the new concepts and learning ideas, tools, functions, and so on. The list can go on and on, but in the end it was a struggle that was worth going through. I'm not exactly the best when it comes to web designing and such, but learning how to use Semantic UI and properly utilizing it in developing a website proved to be quite useful and efficient as I mentioned previously. I will be honest, when it came to learning things about Semantic UI and applying it to website development, along with learning how to use HTML and CSS, it was the most fun I've ever had in coding. To some others this does seem a bit simple and probably has limited uses in comparison to C/C++ and whatnot; I'm not too sure since I haven't thought about comparing any of these coding languages that much. They do have their 'ups and downs'. 

In short, Semantic UI did provide what I needed to make things more interesting for me when it came to coding, organizing, designing, and managing. My understanding towards web development, to me, seems to be better after going through the long minutes to hours of video tutorials and text, and going through multiple assignments that took quite an effort to learn and get used to.
