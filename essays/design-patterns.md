## The Art of Design Patterns and its Benefits
-----
A common interview question is “What are design patterns?”, followed by “What design patterns have you used in your own code?”

For this technical essay, you will write an interesting and informative technical essay that ends up answering these two questions. By doing so, you’ll be better prepared to answer this question if it comes up in an interview.

Do not, under any circumstances, write two paragraphs, one with the title “What are design patterns?” and one with the title “How I have used them in my code.” That will get you no points, as such an essay would be too boring for anyone to read.

Instead, write an essay, perhaps using metaphor or analogy, which by its conclusion has answered these two questions but in a clever, interesting, and informative fashion.

When a problem, or multiple problems, occur in some software design, solutions are used to combat against these whenever they arise; of course the problem isn't solved immediately all the time but these solutions will hopefully function in a way that will assist coders and software designers along the way. If these problems are reoccurring, specific solutions will be used for these situations; and if no solution is currently available there will be one eventually. These solutions in this situation are called design patterns.
