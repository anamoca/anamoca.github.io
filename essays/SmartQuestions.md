## How people ask questions and why
From a computer engineering perspective, coding in general can be hard. The difficulty can differ among many others in different ways. And because of that difficulty these people, especially the fresh coding starters, tend to ask questions too soon and seem like they're ready to give up; although there are others who actually spend the time to work on coding problems but like I mentioned there are varying situations. Whatever the situation may be, how people ask the question is the main topic at hand. When people ask for help on a specific situation, other people that can provide that assistance sometimes follow along the lines of "depending on how you ask the question I will give you the answer accordingly based on my current knowledge". Considering this there have been situations of miscommunication between others along with misunderstandings that can lead to dangerous situations that may insult or demean different parties involved with these problems. Sometimes the personality of some specific people may be an issue to deal with between the two parties, one of which is asking the question and the other that is willing to provide the assistance. Which considers the idea of how one should go about asking a question in a "smart way" that can benefit others without having to cause issues in providing assistance and solutions.

## What does it mean to ask in a "smart way" and a "not so smart way"?
Asking questions are definitely a good thing because it may mean that the people asking these questions are interested in that specific topic. Although, it can also mean another thing where they just simply want to get that problem out of the way and be done with it without providing any effort at all in finding a solution themselves. Asking questions in a "smart way" can be a subjective topic to think about. Although, there are some specific things to look at when wanting to ask a question, even when it comes to asking for help on specific work and such. Answers and solutions to problems do not simply just fall on one's lap; a solution cannot be given out so willingly just because someone asked "hey how do I do this specific problem?". There are many ways that could affect what kind of response you may get when asking others, especially on social media websites or websites like StackOverflow; this topic of asking questions in a "smart way" doesn't necessarily have to apply to only coding either, considering it may help with various other situations as well. As mentioned there are many factors that could affect how you can get a response and what type of response you will likely get. The factors that affect this can include grammar, methods of contact, how you word your questions, proof of effort, and so on; this is basically what Eric Steven Raymond has mentioned in his essay regarding this specific topic of how one should ask questions in general, especially when it comes to coding, along with how to answer them as well. 

Grammar and wording can affect how you ask and answer questions. Along with showing the effort that the work has been at least attempted multiple times. When asking questions, either in person or through forums and such, being presentable and willing to learn the material can definitely show others that you'd want to learn and you can at least provide the effort to. People that do this tend to be provided the help they ask for. This example could potentially be a ["smart way"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54357190/c-dangling-pointers-and-memory-leaks) to ask a question. In this person's question, they presented the problem along with showing that they've done the effort to attempt it a few times. In addressing the problem they even made their question and work presentable.




## Why is the "smart way" important for software engineers?
