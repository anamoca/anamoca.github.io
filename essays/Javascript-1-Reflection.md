## What I Think About Javascript
Although I am completely new to this coding language, Javascript does seem similar to coding languages that I am familiar with, such as C/C++. The semester did just start, but Javascript seems to not be too difficult, most likely due to the fact that I had coding experiences beforehand. Tools such as freecodecamp.org did provide a good amount of help to get up to speed with Javascript and its basics. It does seem a bit early to provide thoughts about Javascript in my opinion, but as I mentioned before it does seem familiar in relation to previous coding languages that I have learned in my previous years in UH Manoa.

## Is Javascript Good or Bad?
Javascript can be a good or bad programming language depending on the situation, but in general I do think it's a good programming language considering the different learning experiences that I can possibly gain from this coding language. Such experiences can be applied to other situations as well, such as the similarity in syntax, different algorithms to apply, and so on. 

## What I Think About Athletic Software Engineering
Considering the few practices with the WODs taken this early in the semester, it seems to be a good way of learning. Although, in my opinion, it does seem a bit faster-paced that expected but pace can differ among others. On the first actual WOD in class, it did seem a bit stressful to think of a solution immediately; of course it shouldn't be a problem for those that have practiced prior to the WOD. The limited amount of time and expected time to put into this WOD may have caused some of that stress to occur along with how open-ended the solution is, which did happen a few times for other courses similar to this ICS course. But the stress can take a bit of a toll on some others that may or may not affect their thinking, as such this habit might be something worth working on during this semester as well as learning Javascript. Regardless, it does seem helpful especially aftwards when solutions are explained and then practiced later on to be able to gain that understanding that was possibly missed during the WODs. It will definitely work out in the end for me as well as others considering we can expect to have alot more practice opportunities for the upcoming WODs and practices.
