## What Is Ethics To Me?
Ethics to me, in terms of Software Engineering, seems to have the similar concept of how ethics is applied to many other things in life. From my standpoint, ethics refers to morals and/or principles in relation to what a person is doing in a given situation. I've heard situations where people would ask others, "is this ethical?" or "in what way is this ethical?". As mentioned, it does depend on the situation.

I do feel I would be on the side to agree to have my own Facebook account deleted due to trust issues with social medias like this that are out there possibly having similar issues or the possibility to have such issues in the near future.
