## How people ask questions and why
From a computer engineering perspective, coding in general can be hard. The difficulty can differ among many others in different ways. And because of that difficulty these people, especially the fresh coding starters, tend to ask questions too soon and seem like they're ready to give up; although there are others who actually spend the time to work on coding problems but like I mentioned there are varying situations. Whatever the situation may be, how people ask the question is the main topic at hand. When people ask for help on a specific situation, other people that can provide that assistance sometimes follow along the lines of "depending on how you ask the question I will give you the answer accordingly based on my current knowledge". Considering this there have been situations of miscommunication between others along with misunderstandings that can lead to dangerous situations that may insult or demean different parties involved with these problems. Which considers the idea of how one should go about asking a question in a "smart way" that can benefit others without having to cause issues.
## What does it mean to ask in a "smart way"?

## How is the "not smart way" demonstrated?

## Why is the "smart way" important for software engineers?
